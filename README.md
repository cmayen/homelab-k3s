### My Home Lab and in house Sandbox

---

##### Active Deployments

- audiobookshelf
- linkding
- mealie
- ntfy

- renovate

##### Coming Soon:

Deployments from other Kubernetes cluster projects that likely will end up here:
- clusterbulb
- home-assistant
- home-assistant-matter-server
- ollama (with AMD GPU support)
- open-webui

Looking into keeping dnsmasq around for an easy nameserver, or possibly switching entirely to bind.
